# Machine Learning Assignments

These are a few assignments from my machine learning class that I enjoyed working on. 
I've omitted assignments regarding perceptrons and neural networks, since I already have a neural network program up on github that closely matches what I used for my assignments.

All assignments were written in Python using NumPy for computation and PyPlot for visualizations.
